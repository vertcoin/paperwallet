JavaScript Client-Side Vertcoin Wallet Generator

GPG key for validation: http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0xFD948CCC1EAB2FB5

A fork of the bitaddress.org project located at:
https://github.com/pointbiz/bitaddress.org

Provides an all-in-one HTML document with embedded JavaScript/Css/Images. The JavaScript is readable not minified and contains no XMLHttpRequest's (no AJAX). The benefit of this technique is you can load the JavaScript locally and trust that the JavaScript did not change after being loaded. 

END USER NOTES: 

 1) To print QRCode in IE8 you must enable the "Print Background Colors and Images" checkbox on the "Page Setup" screen.

 2) For Bulk Wallet I recommended using Google Chrome, it's the fastest.

 3) Requires IE8+, Firefox, Chrome or sufficient JavaScript support.

 4) Mobile Safari only works with iPhone4 or newer devices.
    Older devices timeout while executing JavaScript.

 5) DO NOT use Opera Mini it renders JavaScript output server side, therefore they might record the private key you generated.

 6) Art Wallet does not work properly in IE8 due to CSS limitations.
